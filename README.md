SE4458 Midterm readme Document

In the project, the bill has bill_total and remaining_amount. When admin add a bill, then bill_total amount is equal to remaining_amount. If the user pay the bill, then the payment amount subtract from the remaining amount and the bill_total doesn’t change. After the user pay all amount of the bill, then the payment status change as true.

Also, the authentication part doesn’t work completely. In database, there is two type of user. System can check the undefined user and print error message. But controlling of the hashed password, there is a problem.
